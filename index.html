  <div id="description">
  <p>I’m a writer, social media junkie, and non-profit communications director. Detail-oriented, dedicated

and resourceful, my approach to communication is focused on the audience and the specific needs of

    the organizations or individuals I work with in new and innovative ways.</p>

<p>Especially talented at distilling complex topics into clear communication, I’ve produced content for businesses as far ranging as law firms and dental offices. In addition, I have designed websites using Content Management Systems for various businesses and started a non-profit that helps those with prior convictions expunge their records.</p>
