  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p>I’m a writer, social media junkie, and non-profit communications director. Detail-oriented, dedicated

and resourceful, my approach to communication is focused on the audience and the specific needs of

the organizations or individuals I work with in new and innovative ways.

Especially talented at distilling complex topics into clear communication, I’ve produced content for

businesses as far ranging as law firms and dental offices. In addition, I have designed websites using

Content Management Systems for various businesses and started a non-profit that helps those with

    prior convictions expunge their records.</p>
