    <br><br>
  <h3>Non-Profit</h3>
  <p>In 2015, I started Redemption, a non-profit that seeks to help individuals with past convictions receive expungements for their criminal records. So far, we have helped 10 individuals set aside their past criminal records. In the role of Communications Director, I doubled our social media presence within a week, designed logos and business cards for my partner and myself, and engaged community leaders and the legal community in our non-profit’s vision for a world in which everyone receives a chance at redemption. In addition, my partner and I jumped to help the community of Flint following the discovery of lead in the city’s water. We rented a U-Haul, collected water donations, and were able to donate 80 cases of bottled water, 20 gallon jugs of water, and a dozen cases of hand wipes to the First Presbyterian Church of Flint.
 <br><br>
Beyond learning the process for starting a non-profit, communications strategies and engaging in countless hours of volunteer work, I learned valuable team-working skills. After all, building organization from the ground up is not easy. I learned that compromise, clear and consistent communication and openness to new ideas was a necessary component to our organization’s success. Together, we have built an organization that is focused on helping people first and raising awareness and sympathy for a population that is often misunderstood and forgotten.</p>

    <h3>Website</h3>
    <br><br>
  <p> In December 2015, I launched a website for White Law PLLC, an Okemos, MI law firm seeking growth in targeted practice areas. Using Weebly, a content management system that allows users to build visually appealing websites efficiently, I was able to write and edit content for the website’s homepage and contact page, create a modern-looking design that was consistent with the firm’s visual brand, and attract new clients in need of legal help. In addition, White Law PLLC consistently ranks high in search engines like Google and Bing under relevant search terms.
<br><br>
This project was challenging for me. While I was able to complete my goals successfully and efficiently, I did not have much knowledge of search engine optimization strategies at the beginning of this process. Through exploring tools like Google Analytics and Google WebMaster Tools and conducting my own research, I learned how to build a website that ranked high in search engines and attracted new clients.</p>
